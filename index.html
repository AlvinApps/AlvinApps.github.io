        <li><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies:</strong> Used by AdMob to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No precise location (GPS) or other personally identifiable information (PII) is collected by the Application itself.</p>

    <h2>2. Communication and Marketing</h2>
    <p>We may use contact information provided through any means to send you important updates, notices, and promotional materials about the Application. You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by contacting us at the email below.</p>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Data Use</h2>

        <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Improvements:</strong> Aggregate usage data to improve gameplay, fix bugs, and optimize ad delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services &amp; Access</h2>

    <h2>5. Legal Disclosures</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <p>All data collected by AdMob is retained by Google per their policies. The Application stores no PII. To request deletion of any data provided or collected, follow Google’s instructions for resetting or deleting your Advertising ID, or contact us; we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
